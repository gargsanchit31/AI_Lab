rel_displace_cost:

1 -> 2,4		(divide by 2)
2 -> 1,3,5		(divide by 3)
3 -> 2,6		(divide by 2)
4 -> 1,5,7		(divide by 3)
5 -> 2,4,6,8		(divide by 4)
6 -> 3,5,9		(divide by 3)
7 -> 4,8		(divide by 2)
8 -> 5,7		(divide by 2)

total cost is sum over these weighted displacements and then divide by 2.

It is monotone because ek bar mein cost can reduce atleast by 1 i.e aless than equal edge cost and hence triangular inequality is maintained.
