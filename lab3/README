operation needs two files (look at sample xor_control.txt, xor_truth.txt)

1. xor_control.txt which must be passed as argument to executable i.e.   ./net.out xor_control.txt
    this control file has following structure

    #layers(k)

    #neurons in L1(input)
    #neurons in L2
    .
    .
    .
    #neurons in Lk(output)

    xor_truth.txt (details in point#2)

    OPTION (currently 'a' means analysis printing error vs iteration;   'demo' means train the network and prompt for input, 'e' means varying eita fixed thresh, 't' means varying thresh fixed eita)

    EITA

    THRESH

2. xor_truth.txt
    (contains the truth table in the form   y1 y2 y3.. ym    x1 x2 x3.... xn)
